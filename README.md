# Creating an Unbeatable AI: Minimax algorithm (Tic Tac Toe)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Funtionality

In this tic-tac-toe game, you can :
- Play against an unbeatable computer (the best you can do is tie)
- Play multi-player mode with two players 
- Choose if you want to play as X or O

## Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code 
- React with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Preperation: 

1. Defining boundaries/specs
2. Defining key features
3. Finding sub features 
4. Establishing a time-line for feature functionality 

## The project:

I had a lot of fun creating this game! React allowed me to focus most of my time on the minimax algorithm as I didn't have to worry to much about spending too much time putting the asthetics together since React makes it a relative breeze compared to assembling/testing the logic and functionality of the algorithm.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
